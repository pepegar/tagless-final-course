# Tagless Final

Repo for tagless final training in Scala.  The repo takes the user through several ways of composing software:

1. subtyping.  Uses classical subtyping polymorphism
1. effects.  Same subtyping but makes code more _honest_ by adding effects
1. tagless1.  Moves from subtyping polymorphism to ad-hoc polymorphism
1. tagless2. Makes the instances truly polymorphic
